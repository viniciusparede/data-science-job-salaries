    "# About Notebook\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The work of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is essential in any data analysis study. This is because, before any type of modeling or inference is performed, it is necessary to deeply understand the data that will be used. EDA allows the researcher to get to know the characteristics of the data, such as its distribution, correlation between variables, presence of outliers, among other relevant aspects. With this information in hand, it is possible to make more accurate choices about the type of model to be used, necessary pre-processing, variable selection, and so on. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>In addition, EDA can help identify data quality issues, such as inconsistencies, missing values, or measurement errors. By detecting these issues, they can be corrected, thus improving the quality of the analysis as a whole. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The main objective of this notebook is to apply the process of EDA, which records the salaries of professionals in the data career, interpreting them to present based on numbers and data.</p>"

We were able to identify missing values, outliers, and potential relationships between the variables. Moreover, we used different visualization techniques to represent the data in a meaningful way, allowing us to communicate our findings more effectively.</p>\n",

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Through the use of various statistical measures and machine learning models, we were able to uncover patterns and make predictions about the data. We applied feature engineering techniques, such as vectorization and clustering, to create new variables and classify the data into meaningful categories.</p>\n",

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Overall, this project helped us to better understand our data and make informed decisions based on the insights gained. The knowledge and insights gained from this exploratory analysis can be used to develop further analysis or to create more complex models that can be used to make predictions about future data.</p>"
